# TermDepositCalculator
Calculate term deposit
I chose to use the CLI.
User is asked to enter the amount, rate, investment term and interest paid (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually, At Maturity).
Validation were added to the use input before the call to the manager to avoid redundant processing. 
Output is the final amount calculated for the above inputs.
